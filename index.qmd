-   A dynamic visual model operational in environments like the web.

-   Initially developed through Flash or Java Applet programs in 1990s.

-   Adaptable in various forms for extension, transformation, and
    selection.

-   Can be employed for conceptual understanding in teaching and
    learning mathematics.

-   Offers interactive opportunities for diverse mathematical learning.

-   HTML5 was released in its public version in January 2008.

-   With the introduction of HTML5 web standards, became available on
    mobile devices.

-   15 fraction lessons via video conferencing programs

### `Key Lesson Features and Results`

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Lessons on Equivalent Fractions, Adapted from MSTAR Interventions
    (The University of Texas at Austin, 2011)
-   Use of digital materials (i.e., virtual manipulatives, interactive
    whiteboard, and online assessments)
-   Explicit instructions (i.e., lesson sequence of Introduction,
    Demonstration, Guided Practice, Independent Practice, and Closure)
:::

-   Students' performance improved as the intervention was introduced;
    however, the extent and maintenance of improvement varied according
    to the students' participation.

## `Meta-Analysis: Three-Level Multilevel Modeling for Single-Case Data`

Source: [Shin et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00144029211007150)

![](figures/meta-analysis.png)

-   35 studies published since 2000 on the effects of using virtual
    manipulatives for students with disabilities

-   Case-level variables: grade and disability

-   Study-level variables: pre-training purpose, Instructional method,
    type of virtual manipulative, Visual model

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### `Multilevel Data Structure`

-   Single-case design data are hierarchically structured and can be
    displayed using three-level multilevel modeling (Baek et al., 2022;
    Moeyaert et al., 2021; Pustejovsky & Ferron, 2017).

-   The levels examine repeated measurement occasions (Level 1) nested
    within cases (Level 2) and cases nested within studies (Level 3).

-   Applied a piecewise linear regression approach by separately
    modeling time trends in the baseline and intervention phases (Singer
    & Willett, 2003).

![](figures/mlm-data-structure.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Level 1 equation`

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{i j k}=& \beta_{0 j k}+\beta_{1 j k} \text { Intervention }_{i j k} \\
&+\beta_{2 j k} \text { Time }_{i j k}^{\prime} \times \text { Intervention }_{i j k}+e_{i j k}\\
& \text { with } e_{i j k} \sim N\left(0, \Sigma_e\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

$y_{i j k}$ = mathematical accuracy at the measurement occasion, $i$ th
$(I=0,1, \ldots I)$, for the $j$th case$(j=1,2, \ldots J)$ in study $k$;
$\beta_{0 j k}$ = baseline level; $\beta_{1 j k}$ = change in level when
the intervention phase starts (immediate effect); $\beta_{2 j k}$ =
change in slope between the baseline and the intervention phase; and
$e_{i j k}$ is an error term that is assumed to be independent and is
normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance of $\sigma^2$.

-   Random effects of immediate outcomes and trends during the use of
    virtual manipulatives were examined across various cases and
    studies.

-   The interactions between each intervention effect and its moderating
    variables were investigated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### `Key Findings`

-   Both the average immediate effect and trend during the intervention
    were statistically significant.
-   The average immediate effect varied significantly by student grade,
    disability type, developer, device, type of virtual manipulative,
    and visual model embedded in virtual manipulatives.
-   Neither student characteristics nor intervention feature--related
    moderators significantly influenced the average trend during the use
    of virtual manipulatives.
-   `Deviations in the moderation effects corroborate the need to examine trends during the use of virtual manipulatives, even after the immediate effects have been observed (Shin et al., 2021, p. 431)`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `Conclusion and Future Directions`

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   The methodology for identifying evidence of interventions can vary
    based on research design and purpose.
-   Visual analysis of graphical data is necessary to validate the
    functional relationship and intervention effects in the case study.
-   Moderation effects can be further examined through meta-analysis of
    single-case design data or studies.
